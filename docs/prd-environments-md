Understood. I’ll prepare a comprehensive implementation document covering how to:

* Develop and package the six cybersecurity-focused environments using the Verifiers library
* Register and publish them to the Environments Hub
* Train reference models (starting with Qwen) using both local and full-stack Prime Intellect infrastructure

The guide will include instructions for local development, Verifiers tooling, Environments Hub integration, and scalable RL training with `prime-rl`. I’ll also address rollout, evaluation, and community contribution workflows.

I’ll get started and let you know when it’s ready.
