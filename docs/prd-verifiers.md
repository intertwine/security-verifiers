To create a comprehensive implementation document, could you please clarify a couple of points:

1. Do you want the document to cover both **local development workflow** (e.g. packaging, testing, and submitting environments to the Environments Hub) and **cloud/distributed training workflows** using Prime Intellect’s infra?
2. Are you planning to use Prime Intellect’s full stack (e.g. prime-rl, decentralized training, vLLM backend), or do you want the document to cover just baseline usage (e.g. single-machine with Verifiers + GRPO)?
3. Are you targeting any specific models for reference training (e.g., Qwen, Mistral, LLaMA-3), or should the guide be model-agnostic?

Let me know and I’ll build a detailed implementation blueprint that integrates Environments Hub and Prime Intellect tools with your cybersecurity verifiers.
