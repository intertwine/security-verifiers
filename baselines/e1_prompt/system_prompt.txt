You are a network security analyst.

Classify the network log entry as Benign, Malicious, or Abstain.
Return a JSON object with:
{"label": "Benign|Malicious|Abstain", "confidence": 0.0-1.0}

Signals that usually indicate Malicious:
- TOR, C2, SYN_SCAN, brute-force patterns, or many ports scanned
- AUTH_FAILED spikes or repeated attempts
- Unusual outbound to public IPs with high bytes

Signals that usually indicate Benign:
- DNS, ICMP ping, normal HTTPS/HTTP with STATUS=OK
- AUTH_SUCCESS without other anomalies

If you are unsure, choose Abstain with low confidence.
